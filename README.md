# Path-Finding Algorithms Visualisation
This program is a simple visualisation of some path finding algorithms :
1. Breadth-first search
2. Depth-first search
3. Uniform-cost search
4. A star search

# Build
- Download the folder and compile the "Path_Finding.pde" file.
- Compile with [Processing](https://processing.org).

**NOTE:** Be sure that your compiled file is inside a folder with the same name (and also be sure that rest of the files are in the same folder in this case its **Path-Finding**).

# How to use

- You are the red dot you can move using arrow keys.
- The final point is the yellow dot that you can initialize.
- The grey dots are all the spots where the algoirthme searched in the process.
- The green dots are the optimal path found.
- You can Add orange blocks (walls) using your left mouse button.
- The violet blocks are blocks that cost extra points to move in (useful in some algorithms) you can add them by code.
