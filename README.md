# Path-Finding Algorithms Visualisation
This program is a simple visualisation of some path finding algorithms :
1. Breadth-first search
2. Depth-first search
3. Uniform-cost search
4. A star search

# Build
- Download the folder and compile the "Path_Finding.pde" file.
- Compile with [Processing](https://processing.org).

**NOTE : ** Be sure that your compiled file is inside a folder with the same name (and also be sure that rest of the files are in the same folder in this case its **Path-Finding**).
